## Hello 👋
I am Garv Patidar, a sophomore at IIT Delhi, majoring in Electrical Engineering (Power & Automation). I love to find creative solutions to technical challenges, and I enjoy transforming complex ideas into simple, functional designs.. 
<!--
**garv-patidar/garv-patidar** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on
  - Developing IoT-based solutions like TPMS systems for mining trucks
  - Crafting efficient algorithms for problems like bin-packing through AVL trees and hash- 
    based data structures
    Developing a differential drive system using Sabertooth motor drivers and Kangar 
    controllers for ABU Robocon 2025 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
  - Advanced communication protocols like LoRaWAN for IoT applications
  -  RTK (Real-Time Kinematics) to achieve 1 cm precision wiht GPS
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
  - IoT and embedded systems projects, especially in environments like mining and transportation
  - Algorithm-driven solutions that require innovative approaches to data handling and optimization
- 💬 Ask me about
  - GPS tracking systems, IoT sensors, and real-time data integration.
